## **Project Name** - Sales Prediction Using Python

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

* In this task, I have used the Advertising Dataset to predict sales based on TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising budgets.
* I performed an analysis and visualization of the dataset to understand the relationships between features and identify outliers.
* I trained several models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR).
* The Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance with an R-squared value of 0.978260, indicating very high accuracy.
* I created a dataframe of actual and predicted values for each model to demonstrate their effectiveness.
* Finally, I visualized the actual and predicted sales values, showing a close match for the best-performing models and confirming their reliability.

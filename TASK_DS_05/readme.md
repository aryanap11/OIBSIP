## **Project Name** - Sales Prediction Using Python

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

* In this task, I have used the Advertising Dataset to predict sales based on TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising budgets.
* I performed an analysis and visualization of the dataset to understand the relationships between features.
* I trained the model using the Linear Regression Algorithm and achieved an R-squared value of 0.91, indicating high accuracy.
* A dataframe of actual and predicted values was created, demonstrating the model's effectiveness.
* Finally, I visualized the actual and predicted sales values, showing a close match and confirming the model's reliability.

* In this task, I have used a car price prediction dataset to predict car prices based on various features such as the car's age, fuel type, transmission, and more.

* I performed an analysis and visualization of the dataset to understand the relationships between features and identify outliers. 
* I used techniques such as capping to handle outliers effectively.

* I trained several models: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Xtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) Regressor.

* The Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance with an R-squared value of 0.948871, indicating very high accuracy.


* Finally, I visualized the actual and predicted car prices, showing a close match for the best-performing models and confirming their reliability.

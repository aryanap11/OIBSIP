## **Project Name** - Iris Flower Classification

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

- In this task, I used the Iris Flower dataset and implemented the Logistic Regression algorithm to build a classification model.
- The model successfully categorized the flowers into their respective species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
- The model achieved an accuracy of 97.78%, demonstrating its high effectiveness in classifying the Iris flower species.
- I tested the model with a fresh set of data and obtained accurate predictions, further validating the model's reliability.
